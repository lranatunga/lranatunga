### Hello there 👋 I'm Lakmali Ranatunga. 

#### Welcome to my GitHub profile.


I have a degree in Agricultural Technology and Management and a Master's in Organizational Management. I have been working as a banker for the last 8 years. (I know, quite unrelated, right? :confused:) Suddenly I developed an interest in programming!!:sunglasses:

So, currently, I'm following a Full Stack Web & App Development course at WBS Coding School. I'm excited about what I learn.🙂
 

I'm learning CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Figma, Bootstrap and many more to come :star2:.

I like reading :books:, travelling :train::oncoming_taxi::red_car: and watching :tv: when I'm free.
