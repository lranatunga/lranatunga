align="center"### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lakmali Ranatunga. 

##### Welcome to my GitHub profile.


I have a degree in Agricultural Technology and Management and a Master's in Organizational Management. I have been working as a banker for the last 8 years. (I know, quite unrelated, right?  ) Suddenly I developed an interest in programming!!

So, currently, I'm following a Full Stack Web & App Development course at WBS Coding School. I'm excited about what I learn. 

I'm learning CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Figma, Bootstrap and many more to come.

I like reading, travelling and watching tv when I'm free.
